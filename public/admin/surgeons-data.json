Recognized for delivering balanced, natural-looking outcomes, he blends meticulous planning with advanced surgical techniques to restore harmony and confidence for patients with congenital, developmental, and post-traumatic asymmetry.",
      "expertise": "Dr. Peterson specializes in comprehensive correction of facial asymmetry using 3D imaging, virtual surgical planning (VSP), and patient-specific guides and implants. His surgical repertoire includes orthognathic jaw realignment, genioplasty, zygomatic and mandibular contouring, septorhinoplasty to re-establish the midline, and SMAS-based facelift and necklift techniques to recalibrate soft-tissue vectors. He frequently integrates autologous fat grafting, periorbital rejuvenation, and precise soft-tissue balancing to refine symmetry in a single-stage or staged approach.\n\nIn hemifacial microsomia, Dr. Peterson collaborates closely with orthodontics and restorative dentistry to coordinate occlusion-driven planning. He employs distraction osteogenesis when appropriate, custom mandibular implants for volume and projection restoration, and targeted soft-tissue augmentation to improve contour and function. For nuanced or secondary asymmetries, he utilizes selective chemodenervation, filler camouflage, and minimally invasive adjustments to fine-tune results while preserving a patient’s unique features.",

He employs a modified deep-plane approach to reposition descended facial ligaments and restore jawline definition, carefully planning incisions to preserve sideburn position and beard-bearing skin to avoid feminizing or distorted outcomes. For thicker male skin and heavier necks, he complements lifting with selective fat contouring and platysmaplasty, achieving durable, low-scar results.\n\nIn male rhinoplasty, Dr. Carter prioritizes structural support and airway function alongside aesthetics. He customizes dorsal lines to remain straight and strong rather than overly reduced, uses grafting (including spreader and alar batten grafts) for long-term stability, and favors preservation and open-structure techniques when indicated to refine the tip without over-rotation or excessive narrowing. His planning uses high-resolution photography and simulation to align expectations while emphasizing subtlety.\n\nFor male body contouring, he performs high-definition liposculpture, gynecomastia correction (combining gland excision with energy-assisted liposuction when appropriate), and abdominal etching that enhances natural musculature. He integrates ultrasound- or radiofrequency-assisted technologies to improve skin retraction and employs meticulous aftercare protocols, including compression, lymphatic therapy, and activity-specific recovery plans tailored to active lifestyles.",
